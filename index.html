	<h1>Welcome to Middle Age Arts</h1>

		<h2>Middle Ages Art</h2>

			<p>
				Art during the Middle Ages saw many changes and the emergence of the early Renaissance period. Byzantine Art was the name given to the style of art used in very early Middle Ages Art. This period was also known as the Dark Ages ( 410 AD - 1066 AD ). The Dark Ages were followed by the Medieval era of the Middle Ages (1066 - 1485) and changes in Middle Ages Art which saw the emergence of the early Renaissance Art. To appreciate the full extent of the changes in Middle Ages Art and the Early Renaissance it is helpful to 	understand its fore-runner - Byzantium Art and its effects on art during the Middle Ages.

		<h2>Medieval Gothic Art - Advances of Art in the Middle Ages</h2>

			<p>
				The Later Middle Ages saw the emergence of Gothic Art and the advances of art in the Middle Ages. During this period artists broke away from the influences of the Byzantium and Romanesque art style. It developed into Gothic and Middle Ages visual art. The artists and painters were founders of the movement towards greater realism which culminated in the Renaissance art style. Middle Ages art saw changes which included:

		<h2>New This Month</h2>

			<p>
				This month Middle Age Arts introduces the Gargoyle Collection. I'm really excited about this new set of classical figures.
			</p>

			<p>    
				The collection contains faithful reproductions of gargoyles from some of the famous cathedrals of Europe, including Notre Dame, Rheims and Warwick Castle. All reproductions are done to exacting and loving detail.
